Hello there! I'm excited to share my journey in the world of software development with you. It's been quite an adventure since I
graduated from Amedeo Avogadro Institute in Turin back in 2019. Fast forward to today, I've spent the past three years thriving at
Exprivia, a fantastic company where I've honed my skills and embraced new challenges.
